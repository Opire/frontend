# LLM Assistant Guide

## Purpose

Before reviewing, generating or modifying code, identify the relevant topic in the table and open the linked doc. Use only conventions defined there.

## Topics and Docs

| Topic          | Documentation Path     | keywords                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Code standards | docs/code-standards.md | Best practices, code standards, code aquality |
| Components     | docs/components.md     | Component, ui, design system                  |

## Good practices

- Consult relevant docs before proposing or applying changes.
- Follow guides defined in docs
- Cite relative paths and key snippets when applicable.

## Conflict resolution

- If instructions clash, ask and suggest modifying the docs.
- When documentation is lacking, indicate the gap and propose how to obtain it.
- Record doubts concisely in [`docs/open-questions-llm.md`](docs/open-questions-llm.md).
- Always seek confirmation before implementing sensitive changes.
